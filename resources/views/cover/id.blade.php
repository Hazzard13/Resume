                Dear id Software,
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                With a background in full stack web development, and working with all the necessary flexibility of a small company, I believe I'm exactly the type of generalist needed for a position like Services Programmer. I've been working in my current position for 6 years now, and over that time I've handled <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects') }}">dozens of projects</a>, working these kinds of problems every day. I've handled <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects.food_skills_library') }}">large databases</a>, with specific needs like generating PDFs from that data, or even complex tasks like <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects.znanja') }}">integrating a highly custom WYSIWYG editor</a> for thousands of users. We also frequently chose new technologies for each project we worked on, which has given me broad experience in <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('technologies') }}">dozens of technologies</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Going beyond technical ability, I also have strong interpersonal and communication skills. I've <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects.grace_church') }}">led teams before</a>, and even have experience hosting public events. I've also been fully remote for several years now, working as a self-led generalist to pick up and learn new technologies as they're needed for the problems I have to solve. Of course, I'm also passionate about games, and id's recent gameplay-first vision has been producing some of the best games ever made. All of that combined makes me confident that I'd be a good fit with id Software, and capable of working with the many internal teams this position requires.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Thank you for your consideration.
