            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Hi! I'm Nathan Hazzard, and <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects.this_site') }}">this site</a> is my personal resume. I'm a full stack developer, who's spent the past 5+ years working on a <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects') }}">wide variety of projects</a>, both professional and volunteer, and being exposed to a wide variety of <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('technologies') }}">different technologies</a> along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                I'd consider my greatest strengths to be my abilities to work with people, both clients and coworkers, as exemplified in projects like my <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects.grace_church') }}">volunteer work</a> or community things like my time <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects.idle_wizard_wiki') }}">leading a wiki</a>. I'm even considering a future in some kind of management role, leading a team of developers through large projects. I have quite a lot of experience handling <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('major_projects') }}">large projects</a>, that may take months or longer to bring to completion, and I've made my mistakes and learned a lot of valuable lessons along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                My other greatest strength would be my ability to learn and adapt quickly. Take a look at my <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="{{ route('technologies') }}">technologies page</a> after only 6 years in this industry, and I think it speaks for itself in terms of my ability to pickup a new language or tool as I need it. Personally, I consider the option to play with new technologies incredibly important, and following what the industry is doing and evolving as a developer is very important to me. I wouldn't be where I am today if I wasn't passionate about taking on new challenges.
