            This site is the personal resume of Nathan Hazzard. Everything on this site is made from scratch, by me. No outside help was used, whether with design, writing, coding, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            In addition, this site is made to be as transparent as possible. I <span class="italic">want</span> you to see my work, and poke around the site itself.
            To that end, this site is built using tailwind.css and alpine.js, and nothing is minified. That means all of this site's code is viewable, directly in the Inspect Element HTML.
            No need to search for sources, or trying to figure out where an event or class is coming from.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Also, anything you <span class="italic">can't</span> see directly here, such as how the views are organized, or how I format my commits, can be viewed on
            <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/Hazzard13/Resume">github</a>, as I've fully open-sourced the site.
