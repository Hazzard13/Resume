                This was a very odd chapter of my life, and not really something I was looking for. In early 2019, I made a new friend in the chat of a game I was playing. And one day, he was struggling with an issue: an update had just come out, and he was trying to update the wiki, but had broken something in a script. Knowing a few things, I decided to help out, even though I hadn't written Lua in years. I made an account, looked at the files, and found the error. This... started a journey, where I helped out more and more with the wiki, until I was accidentally thrust into a position of leadership.

                Lua Scripting
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                One of the first things I did was work with a fair bit of Lua scripting. As a wiki, you may think there's very little here, but you'd actually be surprised! The wiki actually had another developer, who had written scripts to dump much of the wiki data directly from the web version of the game itself. As such, there was actually quite a lot to be done in documenting, automating, and presenting that content. I wrote several tools to display things from our data, often recreating elements from the game's UI directly in HTML/CSS. This was an enjoyable hobby for quite a while, and I enjoyed writing these tools and documenting them for the community to use. For example, here's the documentation for <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://idle-wizard.fandom.com/wiki/BiS_Guide">the most complicated tool I wrote</a>, a wiki display for an existing popular calculator. In general, I'm proud to say these tools made our wiki one of the best around, and for such a relatively small game!

            <p class="mb-3">
                Writing all of these tools, and trying to teach others to use them, I accidentally became sort of a figure in the community. I knew I could write tools and scripts, but ultimately, the wiki still needed a lot of handwritten content, and I could never do it all on my own. I got a special role on the discord server, of around 500 people, so I could answer questions and help people out. I wrote newbie friendly guides on how to use my tools, like this <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://idle-wizard.fandom.com/wiki/Guide_to_Guides">Guide to Guides</a>. Lastly, I took inspiration from the <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin Progress Reports</a>, and started writing <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://idle-wizard.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Nathanhazz/More_Collaboration!_May_Progress_Report">my own progress reports</a>, and posting them on the wiki, detailing improvements we were making, highlighting the contributions of others, and always encouraging new editors to step up and help us out.

                Managing Community
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                In my time around the community, I was invited to join the game as a beta tester. Being something I've never done, I took it as an exciting opportunity. In that time, I was drawn to help fix a real problem character called Desolator, which none of the other beta testers were familiar with. The community around the game was <span class="italic">extremely</span> unhappy with this character. Basically, Desolator was played with an exploit that the developer didn't understand. There was a language barrier there, with his first language not being english, and he wasn't understanding how broken the character was, or how it was broken. The character had been nerfed several times over months, but without understanding the issue, the changes were ineffective and he remained <span class="italic">far</span> more powerful than the other characters. Many were upset, there were regular fights in discord about whether or not people should play the character. It was a mess, and after so long without a fix, many thought the dev didn't care, and tensions were high.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really didn't want to see these issues get any worse, so I stepped in. Over a couple weeks, with much help from players, I learned how to play the character, what caused the exploit, and how it worked. I communicated at length with the developer, going back and forth and testing builds, reporting my progress, and eventually even just looking at the math formulas myself, mapping them on Wolfram Alpha, and suggesting changes. Finally, after I felt the character was in a good place, I sought permission from the developer, and <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://idle-wizard.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Nathanhazz/Balancing_Desolator">addressed the community directly</a>, hoping to answer their questions and diffuse the tension in the conversation.

                To my pleasant surprise, this went... incredibly well. I had expected flak, and some anger, as these made the character dramatically worse and left players who'd abused him previously unable to make progress, while also changing the way he played a fair bit. However, the community understood the changes, and why we had made them. People unaninimously seemed to appreciate the post, and the changes. As far as I'm aware, the changes worked as well, and I never heard of any future issues with Desolator either. My first foray into managing a tense community went incredibly well, and I'm very proud of the result.
