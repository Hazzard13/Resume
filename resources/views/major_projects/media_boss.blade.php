                Media Boss was the primary project I was hired for at CBC. It's a massive undertaking for CBC, replacing <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500" href="https://www.comcasttechnologysolutions.com/direct-to-consumer-suite/cloud-video-platform">MPX</a> with an internal solution. As you can imagine, changing video publishing platforms is a <span class="italic">huge</span> undertaking for a Broadcasting Company, with practically every department as a stakeholder, and the project was a "High Impact Commitment" (HIC) for the company as a whole.

                A New Project
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                I was lucky to join Media Boss <span class="italic">just</span> as the design was being finalized and the real work was beginning. This gave me lots of opportunities to pitch in, from setting up a CI/CD pipeline with tools like Jenkins and OpenShift (Kubernetes), to championing linting and static typing tools like mypy, black, and pre-commit.

            <p class="mb-3">
                Additionally, having so much experience with working as a solo developer on large projects, I had a unique advantage in understanding the system design quickly. This gave me lots of opportunities to champion the designs amongst the team, and to help the team understand the bigger picture. It's been a place where I've naturally been developing a leadership role for myself, and have been building those skills.

                A Diverse Team
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Media Boss was one of my first opportunities to work with a large team. Soon after I joined, our team would have six developers, a dedicated QA person, an Architect, a Project Manager, an Agile Team Lead, and a Project Owner. Working with a team of this scale was certainly a new challenge, and took some adjustment, but ultimately turned out to be an environment I thrived in. I love the AV Platform Team, and really enjoy having a variety of coworkers to be challenged by and to learn from. I doubt I'll ever go back to working without a team again.
