                Food Skills Library
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                This is one of the first major customer projects I was given when I started at Velsoft. The task was to build a database of skills for Food Processing Skills Canada. Thousands of skills, combined and distributed across hundreds of occupations, this site was meant to replace the hundreds of manuals they were printing each year. A lot of database work, multiple front-end challenges, and even a challenge to <span class="italic">generate</span> those old manuals as PDFs.

                Grace Church
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Grace Church has been a major focus of my volunteer work, as an organization I really believe in. Over the last five years, I've taken an increasingly large role in their tech, starting with putting together services in ProPresenter, and ending in taking charge of sound, lights, cameras, and putting our services online during the pandemic. My work with Grace Church has been an exploration of integrating and <span class="italic">simplifying</span> (there are no paid tech staff) systems, training volunteers, and exploring lots of new skills related to a live production.

                Znanja
            </h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Znanja was the main project I was hired to work on at Velsoft. It's a combined elearning platform and editor. That means you can create elearning in a custom format for the web, and then assign that elearning to students. Naturally, that makes znanja a <span class="italic">massive</span> web app. Systems like reporting, grading, course editing, discussion boards, web conferencing for online classes, and even converting courses to and/or from formats like Word, Powerpoint, PDF, SCORM, and EPub.
